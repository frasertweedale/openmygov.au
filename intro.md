# We rely on myGov, but can we trust its code?


Millions of Australians use myGov to access essential services like
Medicare, the ATO, and Centrelink.  The ***myGov Code Generator***
app is one of the options for enhancing myGov login security.


But is it actually secure?  Services Australia, the agency who
publishes it, claims it is.  But when I requested the app's source
code under Freedom of Information (FOI) laws, Services Australia
refused, arguing that releasing the code would help "nefarious
actors" and compromise security.  In other words: ***"Security by
Obscurity"***.


**True security requires transparency.** Hiding the code prevents
independent experts from auditing the system for flaws.  It also
**denies secure access to government services** for people who do
not live in the Google or Apple "walled gardens", or to **people
with disabilities** and **culturally and linguistically diverse
cohorts** who cannot use the app as designed, but who *could* use
modified or translated versions.


## A merits review at the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART)


After years of waiting for the OAIC's review of Services Australia's
access refusal decision - which they punted on due to the technical
nature of the matter - I applied to the Administrative Review
Tribunal (ART) for review.  In this proceeding I will challenge the
government's claim that hiding public, publicly-funded software is
necessary and in the public interest.


This is not just a fight about source code—it is a fight for the
***right to know*** how our government's essential digital
infrastructure works, and for the ***right to make it better for
everyone***.


The government will use taxpayers' money (probably lots of it!) to
employ top legal counsel to defend their position of secrecy and
control. **I need your help to level the playing field** in this
fight for transparency, security, and freedom.  There is information
about the crowdfunding campaign below.


## Summary of Services Australia's decision:

- Services Australia applied section 47E(d) of the Freedom of
  Information Act 1982, claiming that release of the source code
  *would have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and
  efficient conduct of the operations of an agency*.  Their argument
  has two main limbs:
  - That the release would compromise the security of the systems,
    leading to myGov account compromise or penetration of agency
    systems.
  - That the release would enable people to develop and distribute
    counterfeit versions of the application, leading to myGov
    account compromise.
- Because s 47E(d) is a conditional exemption, they also have to
  show that release would be contrary to the public interest.  They
  argue the cybersecurity concerns outweigh the public interest
  factors favouring disclosure, which include transparency, the
  opportunity for re-use, the opportunity to improve the app, and
  enabling distribution outside the Google and Apple walled gardens.

You can see the original request, Services Australia's decision, and
my OAIC review application letter [Right to Know page for my
original FOI request][rtk-page].  I will publish more complete
records of the case on this website soon.

## Our legal arguments

It's a bit too early to reveal our whole legal strategy :)  For now
I will say that there are are good arguments with supporting
evidence to counter everything Services Australia has said so far.
I will publish all submissions and evidence filed with the ART, from
both parties, as those milestones are reached (subject to
confidentiality orders, etc).


We will **engage expert witnesses to assist the Tribunal**.  Dr
Vanessa Teague, an internationally recognised expert in
cryptography, will provide independent technical evidence on
software security in general and on particular evidence relating to
the myGov Code Generator app.  I am also seeking an expert in
Android application security to give evidence to the Tribunal.


## Challenges and risks

- The Tribunal could agree with Services Australia's s 47E(d)
  Security by Obscurity arguments.  This would set an unfortunate
  precedent in case law.
- We could lose for other reasons.  In which case, the Tribunal may
  decline to make a decision on the s47E(d) exemption, and an
  opportunity to make case law on this important topic would be
  lost.
- Even if we win, Services Australia could appeal the ART decision
  to the Federal Court.


## Budget Overview - How will the funds be used?

I have retained the services of Wise Law, a boutique firm with
specialist experience in both cybersecurity and administrative law.
Because of the public interest nature of this case, they have
generously offered their services at a deep discount.  Nevertheless,
good legal assistance and representation is not cheap.  It is almost
certain that costs will exceed $10,000 - but it could end up costing
several times that.  For that reason, I'm setting a **funding target
of $20,000**.

Not one cent will be wasted.  The largest expense will be Wise Law's
services.  The work they will do includes:

- Review the case up to this point, and research relevant case law
- Assist with drafting the Statement of Facts, Issues and
  Contentions (a critical document that articulates our whole case)
- Assist with taking expert witness statements
- Manage procedural aspects of the case (directions hearings, case
  conferencing, etc)
- Attend substantive hearing(s) in person.  There will probably be
  one such hearing, but it could span multiple days.

In addition to Wise Law's services, funds will pay for:

- Travel and accommodation to attend in-person hearings for myself,
  representation, and expert witnesses, as required.
- Fees charged and costs incurred by expert witnesses in preparation
  of their testimony.
- Any other fees necessarily incurred in the course of this
  proceeding.
- Fees levied by the ART for access to transcripts or other case
  material.
- Fees which could be levied by Services Australia for access to the
  requested information, if successful.

Funds raised will be held in a bank account in my name used
exclusively for this purpose.  **I am committed to complete
transparency and will publish all invoices and bank statements.**

For the avoidance of doubt, raised money will **not** be used for:

- The ART review application fee of $1148, which I paid.  This
  action is on my initiative and I will eat this fee.  I would not
  feel comfortable asking others for money unless I had skin in the
  game myself.
- Domain name registration or hosting costs for this site.  These
  are small costs, and I will maintain the site long after this saga
  is over and accounts finalised.

### What if there's money left over?

If we win the case, Services Australia could appeal in Federal
Court.  Likewise, we could appeal if we lose.  Costs to run an
appeal would likely be an order of magnitude higher than the ART
proceeding.

So, if there are funds left over at the end of the ART proceeding,
we will hold onto them until we find out if an appeal is happening.
If it is, leftover funds will go towards the appeal proceedings.
Otherwise, all remaining funds will be donated to the [**Open
Australia Foundation**][OAF], the ACNC-registered charity (no longer
a DGR, sadly) that operates **[Right to Know]** and other services
aimed at improving government transparency.  **Every dollar not used
for my FOI matter will go to this very worthy charity!**
