<p>My FOI proceeding has barely begun, but Services Australia is
already attempting some dubious legal manoeuvres that could have a
<strong>profound impact</strong> on the conduct of our case. Up to this point,
in the initial decision, internal review and OAIC review, the
Respondent relied only on the <strong>s 47E(d)</strong> conditional exemption.
Suddenly, with <strong>less than a week</strong> until the first directions
hearing, we received notice that they will now rely (at least in
part) on <strong>s 33(a)(i)</strong>: an <strong><em>unconditional</em></strong> exemption that
applies if <strong><em>disclosure of the document would, or could reasonably
be expected to, cause damage to the security of the Commonwealth.</em></strong>
In other words, they will claim that the release of the source code
is a <strong>national security issue!</strong></p>
<p>On this basis, the Respondent intends to apply under s 134 of the
Administrative Review Tribunal Act 2024 for the <strong>proceeding to be
conducted under the Tribunal’s <em>Intelligence and Security
jurisdictional area</em></strong>. If successful, this would “change the
rules” of the proceeding and makes it much more likely that the
Tribunal will deny access to evidence upon which the Respondent
would seek to rely, give greater weight to Agency submissions, or
even <strong>restrict disclosure of its findings</strong>.</p>
<p>There are no serious grounds for the application of the s 33
exemption, nor any legitimate reason to move it to the Intelligence
and Security jurisdiction. To successfully oppose it, we may need
to accelerate the preparation of critical parts of our case. This
procedural development is also likely to <em>significantly</em> prolong the
entire proceeding, because it must be dealt with before the case
moves to the evidence and submissions phase.</p>
<p>It also makes the whole matter more complex. Services Australia’s
unscrupulous tactic will cost both sides more time and money. Our
tax dollars, hard at work! So if you are able to spare some
after-tax dollars to help me and my awesome legal team fight back, I
will be most grateful. To all the supporters so far, thank you!
There’s a long way to go, but it means so much to know that I am not
in this fight alone.</p>
