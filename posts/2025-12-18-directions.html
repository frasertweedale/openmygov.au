<p>Yesterday (2025-12-17) was the first case management directions
hearing in my proceeding. These hearings are used to figure out
timelines for the case, and other procedural matters - things like
Services Australia’s application to move the case to the Tribunal’s
<em>Intelligence and Security Jurisdictional Area (ISJA)</em> - which I
discussed in my previous update.</p>
<p>In the days before the hearing, Wise Law (acting for me) and the
Australian Government Solicitor (acting for Services Australia)
figured out a rough timeline to propose to the ART. We did not
agree on all points - but that is what the directions hearing is
for. We did agree to have the ISJA application decided <em>on the
papers</em> (i.e. without a hearing). Per the directions made, here is
the current timetable for this case:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>by 2025-12-24:</strong> Services Australia must provide submissions in
support of their ISJA application.</li>
<li><strong>by 2026-01-16:</strong> I must provide submissions in opposition to
ISJA application.</li>
<li><strong>(sometime after):</strong> President of ART will decide on the ISJA
application.</li>
<li><strong>by 2026-02-16:</strong> parties must file <em>hearing certificates</em> for
July-September (this means we expect to be ready for the
substantive hearing to be held during the certified period).</li>
<li><strong>by 2026-04-12:</strong> Services Australia must provide their <em>Statement
of Facts, Issues and Contentions (SOFIC)</em> and evidence.</li>
<li><strong>by 2026-06-05:</strong> I must provide my SOFIC and evidence.</li>
<li><strong>by 2026-06-26:</strong> Services Australia may provide further
submissions or evidence.</li>
<li><strong>(sometime in 2026 Q3):</strong> the substantive hearing.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, this case is going to drag on for quite a while!
The good news is that we have lots of time to prepare our evidence
and submissions. And a decent amount of time to respond to any, uh,
“novelties” in Services Australia’s submissions.</p>
<p>I want to say a HUGE THANK YOU to all supporters so far. Over the
Christmas period I will set up the promised website. For those who
supported at “Insider Access” level or greater, I plan to hold the
first Q&amp;A session soon. Stay tuned for news on that!</p>
