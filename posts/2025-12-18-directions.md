# Directions hearing outcomes - timelines and jurisdiction

Yesterday (2025-12-17) was the first case management directions
hearing in my proceeding.  These hearings are used to figure out
timelines for the case, and other procedural matters - things like
Services Australia's application to move the case to the Tribunal's
*Intelligence and Security Jurisdictional Area (ISJA)* - which I
discussed in my previous update.

In the days before the hearing, Wise Law (acting for me) and the
Australian Government Solicitor (acting for Services Australia)
figured out a rough timeline to propose to the ART.  We did not
agree on all points - but that is what the directions hearing is
for.  We did agree to have the ISJA application decided *on the
papers* (i.e. without a hearing).  Per the directions made, here is
the current timetable for this case:

- **by 2025-12-24:** Services Australia must provide submissions in
  support of their ISJA application.
- **by 2026-01-16:** I must provide submissions in opposition to
  ISJA application.
- **(sometime after):** President of ART will decide on the ISJA
  application.
- **by 2026-01-23:** parties must file *hearing certificates* for
  July-September (this means we expect to be ready for the
  substantive hearing to be held during the certified period).
- **by 2026-04-12:** Services Australia must provide their *Statement
  of Facts, Issues and Contentions (SOFIC)* and evidence.
- **by 2026-06-05:** I must provide my SOFIC and evidence.
- **by 2026-06-26:** Services Australia may provide further
  submissions or evidence.
- **(sometime in 2026 Q3):** the substantive hearing.

As you can see, this case is going to drag on for quite a while!
The good news is that we have lots of time to prepare our evidence
and submissions.  And a decent amount of time to respond to any, uh,
"novelties" in Services Australia's submissions.

I want to say a HUGE THANK YOU to all supporters so far.  Over the
Christmas period I will set up the promised website.  For those who
supported at "Insider Access" level or greater, I plan to hold the
first Q&A session soon.  Stay tuned for news on that!
