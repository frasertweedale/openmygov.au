<p>My wonderful legal team have had more work to do, much sooner than
expected, thanks to Services Australia’s <em>wily legal
manoeuvres</em>—specifically, their procedural application to move the
proceeding to the ART’s <em>Intelligence and Security Jurisdictional
Area</em>. Both sides have lodged their submissions in relation to this
application. Now we wait for the President’s decision.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Wise Law have issued their first invoice. Jason
and EJ are generously providing their services at a deep discount
because of the public interest nature of this case. But because of
this sudden and unexpected work, the amount is quite large:
<strong>$7,920.00</strong>.</p>
<p>This really presses home how expensive this fight is going to be. I
am so grateful to those who have pledged, but we are still <strong>a long
way from my funding target of $20,000</strong>. If you are able, please
consider pledging—even a small amount—to help fund this fight for
transparency, security and freedom.</p>
