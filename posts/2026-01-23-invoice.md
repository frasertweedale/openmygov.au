# Welp! First invoice due

My wonderful legal team have had more work to do, much sooner than
expected, thanks to Services Australia's *wily legal
manoeuvres*—specifically, their procedural application to move the
proceeding to the ART's *Intelligence and Security Jurisdictional
Area*.  Both sides have lodged their submissions in relation to this
application.  Now we wait for the President's decision.

In the meantime, Wise Law have issued their first invoice.  Jason
and EJ are generously providing their services at a deep discount
because of the public interest nature of this case.  But because of
this sudden and unexpected work, the amount is quite large:
**$7,920.00**.

This really presses home how expensive this fight is going to be.  I
am so grateful to those who have pledged, but we are still **a long
way from my funding target of $20,000**.  If you are able, please
consider pledging—even a small amount—to help fund this fight for
transparency, security and freedom.
