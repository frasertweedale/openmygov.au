# The ISJA decision + case files published

On Friday the Tribunal decided to grant Services Australia's request
for the Tribunal's powers to be exercised in the *Intelligence and
Security Jurisdictional Area (ISJA)*.  This was the expected
outcome—disappointing, but probably not catastrophic.  It makes it
more likely that the Tribunal will hold closed hearings or suppress
evidence.  Also, intelligence agencies will probably be called to
give evidence.

Although the *decision* was not unexpected, the *reasons* are
another story.  My legal eagles Jason and EJ are rather cross, and
confident that it would not survive a judicial review.  I will take
a couple of days to consider whether to challenge it or not.

In the meantime, you can [read the decision][ISJA decision] for
yourself!  I have finally updated this site with an [archive of
documents][files] from the very beginning (back in 2021!) until now.
Because legal reasons I cannot publish *everything*, but I have
still included descriptions of the files I can't publish yet.

Thanks to all supporters and especially the **many new supporters**
who joined in the last week.  We are nearly 50% of the way to the
target... but with **only one week to go!**  *\*gulp\**   Please
continue to spread awareness about this campaign.  If you didn't
pledge yet but were considering it, now is the time.
