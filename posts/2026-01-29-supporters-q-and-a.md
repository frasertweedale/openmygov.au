# Supporters Q+A Friday 30 January

Do you have questions about my myGov FOI campaign?  Or just want to
join a chat with me and likeminded people?

This Friday evening **30 January, 19:00 UTC+10 (20:00 AEDT)**, I am
holding an online Q+A / meet-and-greet session.  **All of my
wonderful supporters—at every level—are invited**.  So if you are
not yet a supporter but would like to join, [become one
today!][support]

I have shared the link privately with supporters and will do so
again one hour before the session starts.

See you tomorrow!
