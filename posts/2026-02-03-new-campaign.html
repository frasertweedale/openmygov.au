<p>What a nail-biter! With only minutes to go, the <a href="https://www.pozible.com/project/mygov-app-source-code-foi-review-1" target="_blank">Pozible
campaign</a> hit the $20,000 target. <strong>Thank
you to each and every supporter</strong>—especially those who arrived
during the last few days, some of whom made <em>very</em> generous pledges.</p>
<p>And then there was Alyssa Coghlan, who came in clutch with an
absolutely <strong><em>huge</em></strong> pledge: well into the 4-figures. From the
bottom of my heart, thank you Alyssa!</p>
<p>Also, big thanks to the <em>Bank of Mum and Dad</em>, who contributed a
similar amount. I’ve had some expensive misadventures in my life,
but this might take the cake. Thanks for believing in me.
Hopefully the cake isn’t a lie.</p>
<p>So, what’s next? First, I will make good on the rewards and create
a Supporters page on this site. I’ll try to do that this weekend.
I’ll also schedule another supporter update / Q+A session for
mid-February. This time it will be exclusive for the supporters at
the <em>Insider Access</em> reward level or higher. One session a month is
the plan.</p>
<p>Finally, I have created a <a href="https://chuffed.org/project/mygov-app-source-code-foi-review" target="_blank">new fundraising campaign over on
Chuffed</a> so that people can continue to
support this public interest action. If you supported the Pozible
campaign—even a small amount—<strong>you have done your part</strong>. The new
campaign will enable <em>new</em> people to contribute as word continues to
spread.</p>
<p>So, again a <strong>huge thanks</strong> to each and every supporter. Even if
you weren’t able to contribute financially but helped amplify the
message. Keep beating the drum, because this is just the beginning!</p>
