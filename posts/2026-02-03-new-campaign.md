# Pozible campaign: target reached!

What a nail-biter!  With only minutes to go, the [Pozible
campaign][pozible]{target=_blank} hit the $20,000 target.  **Thank
you to each and every supporter**—especially those who arrived
during the last few days, some of whom made *very* generous pledges.

And then there was Alyssa Coghlan, who came in clutch with an
absolutely ***huge*** pledge: well into the 4-figures.  From the
bottom of my heart, thank you Alyssa!

Also, big thanks to the *Bank of Mum and Dad*, who contributed a
similar amount.  I've had some expensive misadventures in my life,
but this might take the cake.  Thanks for believing in me.
Hopefully the cake isn't a lie.

So, what's next?  First, I will make good on the rewards and create
a Supporters page on this site.  I'll try to do that this weekend.
I'll also schedule another supporter update / Q+A session for
mid-February.  This time it will be exclusive for the supporters at
the *Insider Access* reward level or higher.  One session a month is
the plan.

Finally, I have created a [new fundraising campaign over on
Chuffed][chuffed]{target=_blank} so that people can continue to
support this public interest action.  If you supported the Pozible
campaign—even a small amount—**you have done your part**.  The new
campaign will enable *new* people to contribute as word continues to
spread.

So, again a **huge thanks** to each and every supporter.  Even if
you weren't able to contribute financially but helped amplify the
message.  Keep beating the drum, because this is just the beginning!
