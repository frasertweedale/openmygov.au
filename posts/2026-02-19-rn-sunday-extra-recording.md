# Recording of 15 February RN Sunday Extra interview

On Sunday morning I did an interview on ABC Radio National's *Sunday
Extra* program.  The [recording is available online][recording].
Please share it with anyone who might be interested!

Thanks to host Julian Morrow and producer Salomé for taking an
interest in this story.  11 minutes was not a lot of time but I
think we managed to get most of the important points across.
Hopefully I will be able to return with some updates later in the
year.
